## Description

This project was a website designed to explore and display detailed information about the **Rick and Morty** series. While the design was not the main focus, the development emphasized logic and functionality, allowing me to implement advanced technical features and improve my skills as a developer.

_üí°This project represents where I started with React. Looking back, I see areas for improvement, but it was instrumental in shaping my understanding of web development. Today, I approach projects with more experience, better practices, and a sharper focus on performance and scalability._

## Main Features

### Query Strings

To make the site dynamic, I implemented  **query strings**  using  `useParams`  from React Router. This allowed the URL to fetch specific data from APIs, ensuring that users sharing the same URL would see identical results. This feature enhanced the site's interactivity and usability.

### Search Filter

The search filter was more challenging than anticipated. It required solving several issues:
-   Preserving existing parameters while adding new ones.
    
-   Dynamically applying styles based on the URL.
    
-   Combining the  `name`  parameter with other search filters.
    
-   Adding or removing parameters from the query string when clicking filter buttons.
    

This feature improved the user experience by making the search functionality more intuitive and flexible.

### Dual API Integration

While the  **Rick and Morty API**  provided a solid foundation, it lacked sufficient detail, especially for the episodes section. To enhance the site, I integrated the  **TV Maze API**, which provided additional information and images for each episode. By implementing specific logic, I was able to fetch and display complementary data, making the episodes section more engaging and visually appealing.
